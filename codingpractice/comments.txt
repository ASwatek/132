Grader comments on codingpractice
===========================================
general comments:
Nice!  You are the only one who put their name in the README file.  :)


Parts 1,2 (part1.c):
------------------------------

transposeUpper:
transposeLower:
Good idea for outrageous numbers, but you can just use remainder operator:
c = (c - 'a' + num) % 26 + 'a';

transposeString:
you need to null terminate your new string, ret.

main:
LOL, you should write more tests!  It would have exposed some errors in transposeUpper/lower.

Part 3:
------------------------------

Makefile Rule for "process":

process.c:
When you commit code with tons of commented out stuff, please either separate the comments into a block or remove the old code before committing.
Good work!
